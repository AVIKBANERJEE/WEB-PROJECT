>The player controls a long, thin creature,
>resembling a snake, which roams around on
>a bordered plane, picking up food (or some
>other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail
>or the edges of the playing area. Each time
>the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows
>longer, making the game increasingly
>difficult. The user controls the direction of
>the snake's head (up, down, left, or right),
>and the snake's body follows.
